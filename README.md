## 🏗️ Folder Structure

- **/docs/**  
  Contains PDF reports written by team members. Each report covers a specific theoretical topic related to the future of AI, such as ethics, risks, predictions, or opportunities. Files are named by topic and author for clarity.

- **/notebooks/**  
  Contains Jupyter or Colab notebooks with practical coding tasks. These notebooks demonstrate concepts discussed in the theory reports and are named by topic and author.

- **README.md**  
  This file. It explains the purpose of the folder, its structure, and how to contribute.

- **Other files**  
  May include references, resources, or supporting materials relevant to the week's assignments.

## 📝 What Happened in This Repository

### 1. Theoretical Research

Each team member selected or was assigned a topic about the future of AI. They conducted research, wrote a detailed report, and exported it as a PDF.  
**Examples of topics:**
- AI Ethics and Governance
- Risks and Challenges of AI
- AI’s Impact on Society and Industry
- Predictions for AI Development

### 2. Practical Coding

Team members implemented short coding tasks in Jupyter or Colab notebooks, demonstrating concepts from their theoretical reports.  
**Examples of tasks:**
- Analyzing AI adoption trends using Python and data visualization
- Demonstrating bias detection in AI models
- Building simple machine learning models for real-world scenarios

### 3. Collaboration

All work was done in individual branches, following best practices for GitHub collaboration. This ensured the repository remained organized and conflict-free. Each contribution was submitted via pull request for review.

# 📚 Team Collaboration Guide – Week of Theoretical Work + Light Coding

### 🧠 Week Theme: *The Future of AI*

---

## Hey Team! 👋

Welcome back, everyone! This week’s focus is primarily **theoretical**, but **some light code implementation** will also be required. You’ll either be:

* Creating and uploading **PDF reports** for your assigned theory sections, **or**
* Writing and uploading **Colab Notebooks or Jupyter Notebooks** for short practical tasks.

Let’s work smart, stay organized, and keep our repo clean and conflict-free. 👇

---

## ✅ What You Need to Do This Week

### 📘 For Theory Tasks:

1. **Write your report** using Google Docs, MS Word, or WPS.
2. **Export as a PDF.**
3. **Push the PDF to your own branch** (see workflow below).

### 💻 For Light Coding Tasks:

1. Use **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or your preferred code editor.
2. Implement the required code section (linked to your theoretical topic).
3. Save your notebook as `.ipynb`.
4. **Push your notebook to your own branch**.

## 🚨 General GitHub Collaboration Rules (Apply to ALL Work)

Please follow these rules, whether you're submitting a PDF **or** code notebook:

### ❌ DO NOT:

* ❌ Push directly to `main`
* ❌ Push large files (videos, datasets) without approval
* ❌ Use `git push --force` on shared branches

### ✅ DO:

* ✅ Create a **new branch** for each report or notebook
* ✅ **Pull from `main`** before starting and before pushing
* ✅ **Push only what’s needed** (PDFs or `.ipynb`, not temp files)
* ✅ Write **clear commit messages**

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Git Workflow

### 1. Clone the Repo (First-Time Only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### 2. Always Pull First

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Create a New Branch for Your Work

```bash
# For a report:
git checkout -b docs/future-ai-kennedy

# For a notebook:
git checkout -b notebooks/ai-predictions-jane
```

### 4. Add and Commit

```bash
git add your-file.pdf  # OR your-notebook.ipynb
git commit -m "Add Future of AI report/notebook for [your name/topic]"
```

### 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin docs/future-ai-kennedy  # or your branch name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

* Go to GitHub → **Pull Requests** → **New Pull Request**
* From **your branch** → into `main`
* Add a meaningful title and description
* Submit for review

## 📂 Naming & File Tips

* PDF Example: `AI-Ethics-Kennedy.pdf`
* Notebook Example: `Future-AI-Notebook-Jane.ipynb`
* One file = one pull request
* Finalize before pushing!

---

## 💬 Need Help?

* Message on Slack/WhatsApp/Discord
* Create a GitHub issue
* Ask in team check-ins

---

## ✅ Final Reminders for ALL:

✔ Do **NOT** push to `main`
✔ Create **your own branch**
✔ **Pull** before you **push**
✔ **Write clear commit messages**
✔ Keep file sizes minimal
✔ PDF or code – **rules apply to everyone**
